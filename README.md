A sample project to illustrate the problem declaring rabbitmq queues at runtime in spring **2.1.0.M4** (Is not present in previous release).   

To run tests enter:
`./gradlew clean test`

Tests should fail as expected. If spring version is swapped to **2.0.5.RELEASE** in build gradle then the tests should pass
